//! PAM abstraction (spec 01 §3 Authentication, §10 testing).
//!
//! The seam: [`PamServiceFactory`] / [`PamService`] with two
//! implementations —
//! - [`crate::pam::real`] backed by `pam/sys.rs` (dlopen'd libpam FFI), and
//! - [`crate::pam::mock`] (scripted conversations for unit tests).
//!
//! NOTE ON `unsafe`: this parent module cannot carry
//! `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` because the audited FFI child module
//! `pam::sys` legitimately contains `unsafe` (spec 01 §8: "No unsafe
//! outside small, audited, commented FFI modules"). Everything defined
//! *here* is plain safe code; the only unsafe in the whole crate lives in
//! `pam::sys` and `crate::sysffi`.
